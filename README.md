# Spotify Vis

Create a color sorted visualization of a playlist's album covers.

## TODO
- [x] Find an algo to spread out clusters of images in a reasonable way.
    - Can just use the [networkx spring layout](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.layout.spring_layout.html)
- [ ] Implement object detection with [the facebook detr-resnet-50 model](https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50)
